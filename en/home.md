# 🥳 Welcome to the Blabla Linux wiki !

## 👋 Hey there !

You might already know me through the [blog](https://yourls.blablalinux.be/blog). It’s the perfect place for sharing **news and updates** about **Blabla Linux**, our community, systems, and open-source software.

But let’s be honest: a blog isn’t the best place for maintaining up-to-date **installation methods** or precise technical guides. That’s where this wiki comes in !

## 🧠 The wiki's mission

On a daily basis, **Blabla Linux** installs and tests many services. Sometimes, it works right away... and sometimes, it’s quite an adventure !

This wiki is designed to be my **public "cheat sheet"**, available in read-only mode.

* **Why?** So you can benefit from my successes (and learn from my struggles 😉) by always having access to technical guides that are up-to-date and functional.
* **Collaboration?** For now, I prefer to manage the content myself to ensure consistency. But who knows, I might change my mind over time !
